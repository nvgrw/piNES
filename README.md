## Using this repository
To make things easier for everyone, we'll use the git-flow-avh branching model.
You can read about it
[here](https://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/2010/why-arent-you-using-git-flow/).

To set up on Mac with brew:
```
$ brew install git-flow-avh
```

Don't know about the rest.

## Code Style
We are using the [Google C/C++
Style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html). We don't have to
follow it *exactly*, however, it is expected that you at least invoke
clang-format prior to committing so that we don't have merge conflicts.

The Google C style was chosen simply because we were using the Google style for
Java. These styles do differ in some ways, so it may help to read the document
linked above.
